# trove

**trove** is an open source data exploration and observability tool designed for everyone at small, scrappy startups who need to pull, explore, and use dataâ€”PMs, EMs, marketing, partner success, and more. trove is focused on making data discovery and exploration easy, intuitive, and collaborative, without the complexity or per-seat pricing of traditional BI tools.

## MVP Features
- SQL Query Builder (inspired by Chartbrew, but focused purely on exploration)
- Schema and table discovery
- Query history and sharing
- Simple, modern UI for non-technical and technical users alike

## Vision
- Enable AI-powered data exploration and insights
- Integrate with dbt projects to enrich warehouse metadata
- Foster a collaborative, open data culture

## Getting Started

### Run the Full Stack with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- PostgreSQL: [localhost:5432](localhost:5432)

See [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) and [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for more details.

## Database Seeding and dbt Integration

For development and testing, you can use the included dbt project to seed and build your database schema and sample data.

### Reset and Seed the Database

To drop all tables and reseed the database (dev/test only!):

```bash
make db-seed
```

This will:
- Drop and recreate the `public` schema in your Postgres database (deletes all tables/data!)
- Run `dbt deps` to install dbt dependencies
- Run `dbt seed` to load seed data (from `dbt_project/seeds`)
- Run `dbt run` to build dbt models

**Warning:** This will erase all data in the `public` schema. Use only for development/testing.
